This was another fun project to work on!! It was very time consuming, since I had a lot of bugs and
 things to figure out that were complicated for my brain to wrap around. I think the most challenging part was creating the next/back buttons 
 to navigate the chapters with the capability to slide and transition smoothly. It was also tricky trying to figure out the hierarchy, but 
 eventually with patience I could figure it out. I approached the sliding a bit differently than in the video/without jquery, just cause I thought that way was easier to understand. 

 It was fun changing up the colors a bit on the page. I didn't change the fonts much from my original project, because I liked them how they were. 
 If I had more time I would probably spend more time picking a color palette, but I decided to choose colors that make me happy and that are fun/bright! 
 
 I had worked with media queries at my internship briefly, but I had forgotten how to do them, so this was a nice refresher/good learning experience for sure! 

 I asked my parents for feedback and if they would change any of the user experience - they thought it might be nice if I placed the buttons at the bottom of the page, since it looks slightly strange being above the title. I will have to check out some UX/UI formats on other websites to get an idea of how best to present buttons to people :) when I have more time!
